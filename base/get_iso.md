## Get Debian Tiny Installer

You can download a couple of image files of small size, suitable for USB Sticks and similar devices, write them to the media, and then start the installation by booting from that.

Here are the links to the available image files (look at the MANIFEST file for information): 
amd64 - http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/

## or using wget
wget http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
