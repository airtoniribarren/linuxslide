## Debian Tiny Installer

You can download a couple of image files of small size, suitable for USB Sticks and similar devices, write them to the media, and then start the installation by booting from that.

There is some diversity in the support for installing from various very small images between the architectures.

For details, please refer to the installation manual for your architecture, especially the chapter "Obtaining System Installation Media".

Here are the links to the available image files (look at the MANIFEST file for information):
